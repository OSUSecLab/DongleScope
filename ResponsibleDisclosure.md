# Responsible Disclosure

This document is to record the vulnerability disclosure of our paper: [Plug-N-Pwned: Comprehensive Vulnerability Analysis of OBD-II Dongles as A New Over-the-Air Attack Surface in Automotive IoT](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/wen). The events are documented in chronological order.

###August 7, 2019

We reported the discovered vulnerabilities via email to 29 OBD-II dongle vendors, which covers 47 (61%) OBD-II dongles in our study. For the remaining 30 (39%) dongles, we were not able to find the contact information of their vendors. 


### November 19, 2019

It has been over 3 months after our disclosure to the dongle vendors, but we have received responses only from a handful vendors in total. The vendors that have acknowledged our findings include: LELink, HaulGauge, Audew OBD2, BlueDriver. 


### November 26, 2019

Since we found it not effective to directly email the vendors, and also the failure to locate the vendors' contact information, we decided to contact [The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/) to report the vulnerabilities, according to the reviewer's suggestions.


### December 9, 2019

CERT first responded to our report, and assigned an entry **VU#828413**. We started to work with them on this issue.


### February 10, 2020

After extensive discussion with CERT, we both believe the best way for vulnerability disclosure is to publish our research. Moreover, we also decided to delay the publication of the paper, and the paper will not be available until the start date of the conference (i.e., August 12, 2020). This is out of the consideration that the vendors can have the maximum amount of time to patch the vulnerabilities before they are made public.
